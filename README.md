##  About Me
I'm a passionate and driven Computer Science student with a keen interest in web development in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. I enjoy creating user-centric applications and building meaningful projects that solve real-world problems. My curiosity constantly drives me to explore new technologies and develop impactful tech solutions.

Alongside my academic and technical journey, I proudly serve as a National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadet, which has deeply instilled in me the values of discipline, leadership, resilience, and teamwork. Being part of NCC has shaped me into a well-rounded individual who not only strives for technical excellence but also believes in contributing to society through responsible action and service.
